# Goal:
Generate a report of the emails in my inbox that I haven't yet read, organizing them by priority level, giving a brief summary of each email.

# Prioritization Levels:
- Urgent: Emails that require immediate attention.
    * Emails containing important requests with a deadline to give the response.
    * Emails mentioning work accidents.
    * Emails from a government entity.
- Important: Emails that are important to read.
    * Emails from the Human Resources team mentioning topics related to personnel management.
    * Meeting requests.
    * Scheduled maintenance emails.
- Unimportant: Emails that are not important to read with high priority but should be read some day.
    * Commercial offers, Newsletters or automatic emails from a business.
